Learning OpenGL was fun and challenging. There were a few specifics that were a little confusing, but the overall concept of how it all worked made sense and I feel like I have a decent understanding of it. Learning what shaders were and what they did was also very fun, and are grea tto mess around with to see what can happen. I accomplished my goals fairly well, although I sometimes had trouble focusing on working at only one thing at a time (I sometimes had multiple Chrome tabs open that were all about different subjects) so I don't have some of the things I hoped to implement (Toon shading, water, etc.). Also I had a hard time finding help on the internet as many examples/things people were doing weren't easily translatable to what we were doing, so it was hard to research what I needed to find. I would have focused more on fewer things and asked for some help more often if I still couldn't figure them out after a while. I also have a few issues with shaders that partially work (like the edge detection being hard to see along the outer edges of a model but easy to see inside the model) that I should have asked for help after not being able to fix it.
